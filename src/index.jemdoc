I used to co-organize the [acseminar.html A&C Seminar] at MIT. But no more! Please contact the [http://www.mit.edu/~quanquan/acseminar/ new organizers] if you want to give a talk!

== Brief Biography
I am a graduate student at MIT. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [http://people.csail.mit.edu/madhu Madhu Sudan] and Prof. [http://people.csail.mit.edu/ronitt Ronitt Rubinfeld]. I also occasionally visit the [http://toc.seas.harvard.edu Theory CS group] at [http://www.harvard.edu Harvard]. I am enthusiastic about Theoretical Computer Science and Mathematics, and am particularly interested in various aspects of Computational Complexity Theory.

Recently, I have also been interested in theoretical machine learning, especially deep learning. In Summer 2018, I interned at [https://deepmind.com/ Google DeepMind] where I worked with [https://sites.ualberta.ca/~szepesva/ Csaba Szepesv√°ri].

Before coming to MIT, I graduated from [http://www.iitb.ac.in IIT Bombay] with a B. Tech in [http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in Computer Science and Engineering] in 2012. After that, I spent a year at [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/labs/india/default.aspx Microsoft Research India] as a Research Assistant, where I had a great experience working under the guidance of [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/neeraka/ Neeraj Kayal] in the area of Algebraic Complexity.

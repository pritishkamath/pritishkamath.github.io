== Brief Biography
I am a post-doctoral scholar at [https://www.ttic.edu/ Toyota Technological Institute, Chicago] hosted by [http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~nati/ Nati Srebro]. My current research focus is in the theoretical foundations of Machine Learning. I am also enthusiastic about Theoretical Computer Science and Mathematics, especially Computational Complexity Theory.

I obtained my PhD. at [http://www.mit.edu/ MIT] ([http://www.eecs.mit.edu/ EECS] & [https://www.csail.mit.edu/ CSAIL]), where I was very fortunate to be advised by [madhu.seas.harvard.edu/ Madhu Sudan] and [http://people.csail.mit.edu/ronitt Ronitt Rubinfeld]. I used to occasionally also visit the [http://toc.seas.harvard.edu Theory CS group] at [http://www.harvard.edu Harvard]. In Summer 2018, I was a research intern at [https://deepmind.com/ Google DeepMind] (London), where I worked with [https://sites.ualberta.ca/~szepesva/ Csaba Szepesv√°ri]. In Summer 2019, I was a Research Fellow in the [https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/dl2019 Foundations of Deep Learning] program at the [https://simons.berkeley.edu/ Simons Insitute].

Before coming to MIT, I graduated from [http://www.iitb.ac.in IIT Bombay] with a B. Tech in [http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in Computer Science and Engineering] in 2012. After that, I spent a year at [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/labs/india/default.aspx Microsoft Research India] as a Research Assistant, where I had a great experience working under the guidance of [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/neeraka/ Neeraj Kayal] in the area of Algebraic Complexity.

<h1>Great Ideas in Theoretical Computer Science &#8201;&mdash;&#8201; Theory Lunch Edition!</h1>
</div>
<p>Theory Lunch talks are rather informal. It is neither supposed to be like a conference talk, nor a formal seminar. If you are giving a talk at Theory Lunch, then you should perhaps go through the following, to know what is expected of a Theory Lunch talk.</p>
<h2>Guidelines for a good theory lunch talk!</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Talks <b>should</b> be around 20-25 mins. It is advisable to stick to the time limit! You won't be ousted if you don't, but you may receive silent curses from everybody. :P</p>
</li>
<li><p>Spend enough time on motivation and definitions - people are from diverse backgrounds, and you don't want to lose the audience early!</p>
</li>
<li><p>This is not a full-fledged seminar, so don't get unnecessarily technical - it is okay to skip even important technical details, for the sake of clarity and relevance.</p>
</li>
</ul>

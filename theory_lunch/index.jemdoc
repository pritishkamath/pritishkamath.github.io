Theoretical Computer Science is full of great ideas, so once a week, the MIT Theory group gets together to socialize and share some knowledge. We'll briefly share some interesting ideas, and discuss a superset of these ideas over lunch.\n

Add this calendar to yours to receive details about upcoming events in the Theory group\n
